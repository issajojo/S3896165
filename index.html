                <p style="font-size: 25px;text-align: center; color:aqua">My name is John Duong (My online tag is issa jojo but my internet friends mainly call me by jojo)
                    You can find my student email at s3896165@student.rmit.edu. I was born here in Australia in the town of Sunshine.
                    I am Vietnamese and speak it at home with some english mixed in sometimes, mainly to my siblings that I live with.<br>
                </br>I just completed highschool last year and I am currently a first year studying Bachelor’s of Information Technology. 
                    An interesting fact about me is I have a scar on my forehead which had occurred when playing tag in the house,
                     and running into a door with a nail sticking out of it.<br></br>
                      I enjoy playing games with the homies although I think I've sunk a lot of hours into mobas, specifically League of Legends and Dota2 (mainly League)
                       but I am still trash at these games for the amount of time I’ve put into them (:D). 
                       I also like reading manga as well as manhwa, listening to music, and watching anime. 
                       A passion of mine is to try and make my friends happy when they are down or even just to make them laugh when they are not;
                        I also am passionate about supporting and bringing people’s well beings up.

    Interest In IT
</h2>

<p>My interest in IT would have to do with the fact that I had always been around a computer when I was little and I’d say that it was probably my brothers
     that helped spark my interest in them. As for previous IT experiences I didn’t really have any but, in primary school I was the IT guy 
     (although I did not know any programming or anything really, people just did not know how to use- say, Microsoft excel).
     There was also a time in 9th grade when a friend I met on the internet was very interested in coding and kept talking about it, had me wondering what it was like
      so I tried it out myself, not going very far with it. 
      <br></br>
    Whenever university came into question growing up, I thought I'd go to RMIT. This is probably due to brothers and peers and previously went to this university
     and said that it was a decent university to study at as well as being as close to the city as possible (making the commute not so long), 
     which seemed like it wouldn’t be a bad idea; so here I am, giving it a shot.
    I expect to be able to learn and use multiple programming languages, to also have a good understanding of what real world usage of Information Technology is like 
    by the end of this course.

        Personal Profile
    </h2>
    <p>
        The personality tests I find; resonate pretty well with what I think of myself. I am introverted but I’d like to talk to people specifically those who have troubles 
        and are having a hard time- I’d much rather people be happy than being upset. My want to help others would be very helpful in a team setting as people would be able to perform better
         when they are in the right headspace. Although, when I feel like someone is being slack and not pulling their weight in a group project I would get irritated 
         but not so angry and frustrated to lash out at them- rather I’d gently tell them to do their delegated work and if it becomes a bigger issue then I would have to get someone involved. 
         Therefore when forming a team, I would like at least one person of similar thought processes to be in the team and hopefully bring us together when we’re in a pinch.
