                <h1>
                    Project Idea
                </h1>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Anime / manga / manhwa generally release on a weekly, monthly basis and you (a normie (or even a regular consumer for that matter)) 
                    may not be able to keep up with the timings of when they do release as with most people, have other things going on in their lives.
                     For my project idea i will be constructing a website as well as a browser plugin or app (that you could use on your phone), 
                     which essentially send notifications and allows you to track when a manga / manhwa chapter and as well as a anime episode will be releasing, 
                     this along with where to actually consume the media (no, the website will not be where you are able to consume the media but instead the website is like a hub that leads you elsewhere).
                </p>
            </body>
<h2>
    Motivation
</h2>
<p>
    The motivation behind my project actually stems from my own experience as well as some friends / peers, where us being anime / manga consumers cannot be stuffed of going out of 
    our way to first; find the anime / manga we are looking for and then finding out when it releases on another website week by week, 
    where we may just end up forgetting the specific day / time. Another point is that some of us (myself included) do not watch anime on a daily basis 
    (where i know some people (myself who used to do so) would just memorise when the piece of media would release and watch / read it week by week like clockwork); 
    may become annoying to have to remember it especially if you’re watching / reading multiple series at a time.
</p>

    Description
</h1>
<p>
    The product will entail a website, and a plugin / app where you are able to log on and utilise some of the products features
     (however not logging on is also fine, and is still fully functional, it is more for cross device usage). 
</p>
<p>
    The website has 3 main categories; “Anime”, “Manga”, “Manhwa”- in which there are also sub-categories which is the genre tab 
    (that  leads to that medium of media’s (anime, etc) collection of that genre). Upon clicking on whichever main category
     it will lead you to all of this season’s ongoing anime / manga / manhwa displayed in boxes. \\
</p>
<p>
    At the top of the medium of media boxes that are presented, the title of the anime / manga / manhwa will appear along with its author and or animation studio 
    (clicking on these will actually lead you to other works that have been done by these authors or animations studios), genres right beneath the title. 
    The medium of media will have an image, respective of their title and a caption will be displayed which counts down to when the anime / manga / manhwa “episode / chapter” is meant to be released, 
    e.g. EP2 of [Medium of media] :06 d 51 m 03s (and the timer continues to count down until the episode / chapter releases).
</p>
<p>
    If you hover over the medium of media boxes when you are logged in, you are able to favourite it, which you can then have a look at in lists. 
In the medium of media boxes, there will be little icons that could represent social media i.e twitter for that specific medium of media, this way it allows the user to interact
 more with their medium of media preference. It will also include places where you are able to legally (and or “unofficially”) consume the anime / manga / manhwa.
</p>
<p>
    To find previous seasons and or upcoming anime (this will only really be anime specific since it the other mediums of media
     (manga and manhwa only really stem from light novels as source materials but this often does not happen which makes it awkward to show up as upcoming) 
     there will be buttons that will direct you to such, e.g. if it is a previous season, a “calendar” will pop up and you are able to select 
     such time-frame e.g. “Winter 2017 Anime”. As for future content you are able to do the same but instead click forward through the timeline, 
     to the more relevant upcoming seasons as you cannot keep track of an anime that isn’t actually being animated currently (or has not been planned to be animated).
</p>
<p>
    The website will also have at the very bottom, a link to its very own discord server and other information such as an FAQ section, contact section, and an about section 
    as it would be important to know what the site is actually about or what it does. The app would just be a similar version of the website where you are also able to log on 
    and use the product. It also allows for push notifications to alert you when your favourite medium of media updates / releases, this is also the intention for the browser plugin.  
</p>
<h2>
    Tools and Technologies and Skills required
</h2>
<p>
    The website and plugin / app would be created using software or tools like “Visual Studio Code” to write all your coding (HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript).
     To work out the timer / countdown, we would have to manually search up when the medium of media is set to release.
</p>
<p>
    Most preferably be able to use a desktop (of this age- not that you would need a beefy pc as it is only to code) in order to actually write the code 
    (however an ipad or phone is possible just not very efficient.)The skills required would be able to use HTML as this allows you to create the structure of the website, 
    and then obviously using CSS to make the page look better, possibly using JavaScript to make the site more interactive and enjoyable for the user as well as actually designing
     the plugin / app. Python will also be used as well especially for the timer / countdown.
The timer / countdown to when the medium of media releases will be manually inputted by day and time in accordance to japan’s timezone, 
which is then converted according to your own timezone.
</p>
<h1 class="second-h1">
    Outcome 
</h1>
<p>
    Ultimately, if the project is successful, meaning we have; a website, a plugin / app, a tracker and all those features, the original problem of being lost
    when a new anime / manga / manhwa is released and you are not sure where or when to watch / read it or specific episode / chapter is released will then be solved.
     It will remind you (the user) that hey, your favourite anime is airing right now or hey you can finally read your manga / manhwa because it has been updated. 
     This project is meant to act as a convenience rather than an inconvenience. It is meant to be of use in that it solves multiple problems and makes consuming your medium of media easier.
